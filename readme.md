GitHub Viewer
=============

[http://www.githubviewer.org/](http://www.githubviewer.org/)

An example application that connects to the GitHub REST API and displays
users from organizations.  Users can then be clicked to retrieve their
repositories.  Finally, a repository can be clicked and recent commits
displayed.

This is an entirely client-side application, meaning aside from the configured
HTTP server and the remote API, there is no server processing.  All logic is
isolated to JavaScript.
